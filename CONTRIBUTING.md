Contributing
============

We appreciate your contributions! Because DOTT is an open source project, we want to keep it as 
easy as possible to contribute changes. However, we need contributors to follow a few guidelines.

## Coding style

Contributed source code must follow [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style
conventions.

Other formatting requirements:
- 4 space indents, no tabs are allowed.
- No trailing whitespace.
- Lines should generally not be longer than 120 characters, though this is not a hard rule.

## Licensing

By creating a pull request on GitHub, you agree to license your contributions under the same
license as the original code. This is commonly referred to as "inbound=outbound". This enables
contributions to happen in a quick and effortless way and encourages collaboration. 

Since DOTT is released under Apache License Version 2.0, the same license is expected for all
contributions.

## Process

Please create a pull request in GitHub with your contribution.
To make the "inbound=output" principle (see licensing section above) explicit, all non-trivial
contributions are required to include "licensed under: Apache-2.0" in the description of their
pull requests. Otherwise, non-trivial contributions can not be accepted.
