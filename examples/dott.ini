# ELF file containing bootloader symbol and debug information. If omitted, bl_symbol_elf is set to bl_load_elf by DOTT.
#bl_symbol_elf=

# Bootloader symbols are added after the app is loaded. For this, DOTT requires the symbol address. Set to 0x0 if omitted.
# The address shall be supplied as hex value with 0x prefix.

# Name of the GDB client binary. If omitted, it is set to the default one coming with the DOTT runtime.
#gdb_client_binary=

# Name of the GDB server binary coming with a J-Link installation. If omitted it is auto-detected.
